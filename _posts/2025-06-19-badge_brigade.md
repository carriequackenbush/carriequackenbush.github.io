> Our analysts flagged this Roblox experience as possibly being used to pass information in plain sight. Thousands of badges are lined up with no obvious purpose. Think you can find whatâ€™s hidden beneath the noise? <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/85918733347543/SVBGR-Badge-Brigade">https://www.roblox.com/games/85918733347543/SVBGR-Badge-Brigade</a>
