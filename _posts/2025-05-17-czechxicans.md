> When Cameron Snider was living in Europe like a dirty heathen, he used to frequent a popular Mexican restaurant. It was actually really good food. It's quite a shame that it closed down a few years ago. I'd love to go back. I think I left a Google review on the restaurant next door that is still up.

Nothing was pulling up in Google, no combination of Czech or Czechia or Cameron Snider or any of his known usernames. As soon as I started searching in Bing, it pulled right up. There was a Google review from Cameron on the place next door, as stated. Yes, Bing found the Google review better.
